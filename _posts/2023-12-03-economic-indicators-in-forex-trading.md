## What are Economic Indicators?
<p>Economic indicators are statistical metrics that provide insights into the overall health and performance of a country's economy. These indicators can be broadly categorized into leading, lagging, and coincident indicators, each offering unique perspectives on economic conditions.</p>

## Key Economic Indicators Affecting Forex Markets

<p>GDP is a primary indicator of economic health, representing the total value of all goods and services produced within a country. Forex traders closely monitor GDP reports as they can signal the strength or weakness of a nation's currency.</p></li>

<li><strong>Employment Data:</strong> <p>Employment figures, such as non-farm payrolls and unemployment rates, provide insights into a country's labor market. Positive <a href="https://www.daytrading.ltd/learning/employment-report">employment report</a> can boost confidence in a currency, while high unemployment rates may have the opposite effect.</p></li>

<li><strong>Inflation Rates:</strong> <p>Central banks aim to maintain stable inflation rates. Traders watch inflation reports closely, as higher inflation may lead to interest rate hikes, impacting currency values.</p></li>

<li><strong>Risk-On and Risk-Off Sentiment:</strong>
<p>Positive economic indicators can foster a "risk-on" sentiment, encouraging traders to invest in higher-yielding currencies. Conversely, negative indicators may prompt a "risk-off" sentiment, driving investors towards safer assets.</p></li>
</ul>

## Strategies for Trading Economic Indicators
