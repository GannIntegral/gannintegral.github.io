## What is Forex Trading
The foreign currency exchange, known as the forex market where forex trader make money by buying and selling currencies through online forex broker trading platform. Forex is a world largest market compared to stocks, options, and futures where currencies are traded 24 hours a day for five business days a week.

## How Forex Trading Works
For an offline forex trading example, imagine you want to travel from your country, let's say the United States of America, to Japan. In this situation, you need to convert your cash from USD to YEN at a nearby money changer. You are essentially selling dollars and buying yen at the given rates provided by the exchanger. These rates include the actual yen currency value plus some commission charged by the exchanger.

If you find the given rates acceptable and are willing to buy the yen currencies at a specific amount of dollars, the transaction will be completed. Otherwise, you may choose to seek another exchanger offering lower rates.

In <strong>online forex trading</strong>, everything is done electronically through a <strong>forex broker platform</strong> called the Electronic Communication Network (ECN). The transaction between you as the broker's client and the broker as your dealer is called Over The Counter (OTC).

## Forex Currency are Quote in Pairs

> Example: EUR/USD â€“ Euro (EUR) is the base, and the US Dollar (USD) is the quote which is if the price of EURUSD is 1.08526, this means 1 Euro equal to 1.08526 USD.

Due to their large trading volume compared to other pairs, they are actively traded among market players. They are popular among retail traders especially scalpers and daytrader due to their liquidity, which often leads to tighter spreads, making it easier for traders to execute trades and reduce their trading costs.

### Minor forex pairs

Minor forex pairs have lower trading volumes, making them less volatile compared to major forex pairs. This results in a wider spread, making them unsuitable for scalping trading strategies. Typically, long-term traders choose to trade these pairs because their nature aligns with their trend-following trading strategy.

## What is Technical Analysis?

If you look at a forex chart, you might wonder how to determine if the price is going up or down. Here, technical analysis comes into play!

<a href="https://www.daytrading.ltd/learning/technical-analysis-in-forex-trading">Technical analysis</a> is one of the methods used by traders to predict the forex market. With this knowledge, traders can time their market entries and exits as needed. Without mastering this skill, it's like trading the forex market blindly!

### Support and Resistance Level

<img src="https://www.daytrading.ltd/img/support-and-resistance-level.jpg" alt="Support and Resistance Level">

The last known lowest price is considered the support level, and the last known highest price is considered the resistance level. To determine if you are in a downtrend market, you need to observe whether the price is breaking the last nearest low price and respecting the last high price. It is better to refer to higher timeframes such as D1/Daily as your compass and use the H1/Hourly timeframe for trend reference, whether it's a trend continuation, reversal, or sideways movement.

### Trend lines
